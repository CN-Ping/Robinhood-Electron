# Robinhood-Electron
Building a desktop client for Robinhood, planning to support Mac and Windows.

Backend API using [robinhood-node](https://github.com/aurbano/robinhood-node). Frontend implemented with Electron, React-Redux.

Work In Progress (obviously...)

## Planned Features:
 - Login to Robinhood (done)
 - View Simple Portfolio List (done)
    - LeftNav should be displaying all info correctly now, price percentage numbers are calculated using extended hours if available
    - Watchlist and adding symbols outside the existing portfolio will be added later after implementing simple trading
 - Simple Trading  
 - Graphical Portfolio UI with Charts
 - Complex Trading with Customizable Orders
